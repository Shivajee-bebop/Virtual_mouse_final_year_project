Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

This project implements a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It serves as a final year project and showcases the potential of computer vision applications.

Features

Track hand movement in real-time using MediaPipe Hands.
Recognize predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for click, fist for drag).
Control the mouse cursor based on gestures and hand position.
Customizable options for sensitivity and gesture mapping.

Technologies

MediaPipe Hands: for hand detection and landmark tracking.
OpenCV: for image processing and rendering.
Additional libraries: depending on specific implementations (e.g., NumPy for calculations).
